# CameraLite
Lite implemintation of the android camera.
It's a refactored version of this https://github.com/AkramaMirza/snapchat. 

It has minimal features such as:
- switching between front and back cameras
- taking pictures.
- reusable fragment

My problem was that I couldn't get rid of the camera preview being stretched or not being fullscreen
even though I searched everywhere for a solution. Finally, I found that repo and it actually worked. 
I wanted to share it here on Github for my use on future projects
and also for anyone who is stuck like I was.
